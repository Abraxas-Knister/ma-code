# general
twosite DMFT via ED
then play with that and give bath more sites.
then QC solution to general bath problemf 

# twoside, kreula et al. 2016
Hamiltonian is given by

U n1u n1d  - mu(n1d + n1u) + ed n2d + eu n2u 
 + V( c+1u c2u + c+2u c1u + c+1d c2d + c+2d c1d )

here U, mu are given and e(d/u) and V are to be determined
furthermore the Hamiltonian is INDEP of time

Loop: 
    * Set eu, ed, V
    * Get Greensfunction iGs(t)_R  = D(t) < {cs(t), cs+(0)} > = < cs(t)cs+(0) 
        + cs+(0)cs(t) > D(t), D(t) = { 1 t>0; 0 
        # Need Groundstate ??
    * Fourier Transfor to get G(w)
    * Use Dyson to get S(w) = G0^-1 - G^-1, G0 = w+mu - DD(w), DD(w)
        = V*V/(w-es)
    * get V from S, get es from minimising |n-n_imp| (TODO: need to know what
        this is and how we calculate it from G/S)
    * Repeat, since V, eu, ed were updated

ED for greenfunction of twoside DMFT:
 * use four bit int as base vector mask
 * fixed number of particles
  -> 0000
     0001, 0010, 0100, 1000
     0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100
     0111, 1011, 1101, 1110
     1111
    serve
 * implement C operator in schrÃ¶dinger picture in that base
 * get H from that
 * get U from that.
 * until now Hilbert space is only 16 dimensional if any numbers are allowed
   -> matrix exponentiation can be done
